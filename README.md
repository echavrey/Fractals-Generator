# Fractals Generator
 
A fractal generator, using Prolog (specifically SWI Prolog). 

The documentation its inside the program, but in spanish. 
 
## Motivation
 
Passing the "Programming Languages" course on the first semester of the 2015.

## Functionality

Call any function after "dragonPrueba". 

### Parameters
The first parameter, of all the functions its related with the *[level](https://avatarrcl.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/koch.gif) of the fractal.

The second parameter, of all the functions its related with the lenght of the fractal. 

### Colors
If the functions ends with R, then the fractal its going to be created with RANDOM colors.


If the functions ends with C, then the THIRD PARAMETER its going to be a color (of the list on the code): orange, Black, salmon, yellow green, etc.

It will relate the color, with the RGB right combination. 


If the function ends with Base (before R or C), then ignored. It's just the base for a more complex fractal.
